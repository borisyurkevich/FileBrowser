This is a sample project I decided to publush together with a blog post with everything 
I learned so far about working with file system on macOS. There's not many modern working code examples out there. 
I hope this will help someone. It's fun to develop for the Mac, and I hope this helps somone, it always great to 
see more native applications out there.

## Features

- Working example how to use `NSDocument`
- Pick a root folder and get a permanent read/write access without violating sandobx
- No need in full disk access or permission dialogs 
- Monitors files changes
- Basic text editing
